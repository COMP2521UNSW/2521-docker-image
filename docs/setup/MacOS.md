# Set up COMP2521 Docker Image on MacOS

Note: these instructions are somewhat bare-bones right now. They should work,
but it'd be nice to have something a little more thorough. Consider making a
pull request if you'd like to help out!

1. Set up Git by running `git --version` in a terminal. If prompted to download
   extra features, accept and wait for the download to complete.

2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

3. Launch a terminal.

4. `git clone` the repo.

5. Run the setup script and follow its prompts. From the directory you cloned,
   you can run `./scripts/setup`.
